# THE NLPLAY PLATFORM
￼This repository contains the scripts and other resources it takes to reproduce the NLPlay Platform developed by Sofie Ditmer and Astrid Nørgaard Fonager. The main goal of this project was to contribute to the field of Danish Natural Language Processing (NLP). This was accomplished in two ways: 
1. A web-based interactive Shiny application was developed to provide the user with different text mining tools: topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and a word cloud generator.
2. A neural network model was trained on the Danish Gigaword Corpus (DAGW) containing over 1 billion words. 

Hence, this repository contains two main elements: 

# 1. THE NLPLAY PLATFORM
I have developed a R Shiny application that enables you to explore the semantic similarity between words as predicted by the neural network model, generate a word cloud, and perform sentiment analysis. 

# 2. THE DAGW MODEL
A neural network word2vec model trained on the Danish Gigaword Corpus (DAGW) is available as a .bin file.
